This code probably does not fit your needs. Do not use this unless you have
read and understood tor-spec.txt and really know what you are doing.

In here you will find an implementation of a subset of the TOR client protocol
and a TOR consensus parser. As a rule, only the latest versons of the
subprotocols are implemented.
